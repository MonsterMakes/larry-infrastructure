## Overview 
The larry-infrastructure package manages and maintains your development ecosystem. This includes the automated deployment and management of all environments (e.g. Production, Staging, Test, etc...).

The larry-infrastructure package can be consumed in multiple ways (pure js library, REST API, cli, serverless components, and more). The core features of the larry-infrastructure package are exposed as an immersive command line interface (cli) named `larry`. Larry is made up of Cli Modules and Cli Actions. Cli Modules are grouped actions that are exposed to the user as a Sub Cli that can be "entered" to launch specific Cli Actions. Cli Actions can be anything from interactive cli programs to automated tasks that run to completion. In addition to being an immersive CLI Larry's Cli Actions can be launched as traditional shell scripts, which have many uses in the automation of complex workflows such as Continuous Integration (CI) & Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines.
